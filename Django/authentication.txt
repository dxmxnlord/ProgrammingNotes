+ Django comes with a user authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions.

+ The system consists : 

	Users

	Permissions: Binary (yes/no) flags designating whether a user may perform a certain task.

	Groups: A generic way of applying labels and permissions to more than one user.

	A configurable password hashing system

	Forms and view tools for logging in users, or restricting content

	A pluggable backend system

+ The authentication system in Django aims to be very generic and doesnâ€™t provide some features commonly found in web authentication systems. These can be implemented through third-party packages.
