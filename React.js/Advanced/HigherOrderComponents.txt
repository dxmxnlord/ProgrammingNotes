+ a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. Components are the primary unit of code reuse in React. However, you’ll find that some patterns aren’t a straightforward fit for traditional components.We want an abstraction that allows us to define this logic in a single place and share it across many components. This is where higher-order components excel.

const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);
