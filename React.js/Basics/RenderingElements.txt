+ An element describes what you want to see on the screen. Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.

# RENDERING AN ELEMENT INTO THE DOM

+ Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.

[[
	<div id="root"></div>
	// this is a “root” DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.
]]

+ To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to ReactDOM.render()

[[
	const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
	ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
]]

+ React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes.
