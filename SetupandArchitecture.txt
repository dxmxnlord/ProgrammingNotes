+ The entire website is divided into apps which are like modules and can even be standalone websites 

* To start a project :

	$ django-admin startproject <pname>

	- The folder has [ init , settings , urls , wsgi]
	- init tells python to treat your project like a package 
	- the settings file has a section called installed apps which needs to be updated every time you want 
	  to include an app.
	- urls is the main controller of the website and points to the various apps 
	- The manage.py has a bunch of commands that perform different tasks

+ To activate the server :

	$ python3 manage.py runserver

	- This runs the server at port 8000 on your local IP

+ Create an App :

	$ python3 manage.py startapp  <appname>

	- Creates an app folder and a database file.
	- The folder has another folder called migrations and files [ init admin apps model tests views]
	- urls control what is served based on url patterns 
	- models contains database info and metadata 
	- tests let you test you write code to test your site after making a change before releasing it
	- views lets you create views which essentially is what your user will see
